Indiana says it will appeal a federal judge's decision requiring it to recognize the out-of-state gay marriage of a lesbian couple in which one woman is terminally ill.

The state also asked U.S. District Judge Richard Young late Thursday to stay the order while the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals reviews the case.

Young issued a preliminary injunction Thursday extending last month's temporary restraining order forcing the state to list Amy Sandler as the spouse of Niki Quasney after Quasney dies of cancer. It applies only to them, not to other gay couples who were legally wed elsewhere and are seeking to have Indiana recognize their marriages.

The Indiana attorney general's office says that recognition of the couple's marriage now could raise false hopes for other gay couples.
